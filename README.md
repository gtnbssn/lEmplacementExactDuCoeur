In l'emplacement exact du cœur, devices connected to the artwork communicate with each other, wherein the secret messages they exchange amongst themselves drive the evolution of the visuals. The messages are meaningless. This is a networked daydream built on disconnection. Language can act as a spell that constructs bridges across time and space between minds. It can also act as a prison; restricting what could have been with every utterance, simply by defining it.

Céline Minard's 2009 novel le dernier monde follows the last man on earth as he slowly descends into a state of constant daydream, struggling to keep his sanity without the company of fellow human beings. Somewhere in the midst of his delirium these words appear: "the exact location of the heart"—like a punch to the chest, to remind us of our loneliness and the difficulties of connecting with each other.
